# [Forkbin][1]

[Forkbin][1] is github for lists.  You can fork others lists.  You can
use the site at [http://forkbin.com][1].

## Introduction

Jared and me created the site at Techcrunch hackathon few months ago.

The main component that is being used in the project is
[Backbone.Routes][2].  Many people have requested me to create a example
project that uses Backbone.Routes so that they can look at how it
actually works.  Forkbin uses Backbone.Routes, so, you can see
how it works from the code.
